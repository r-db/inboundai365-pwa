# What I Need From You

The "Failed to fetch" error means the browser JavaScript is running but the network request is failing.

## Please do this:

1. **Open**: http://localhost:3000/contact
2. **Open Browser DevTools**: Press F12 (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Take a screenshot or copy ALL console messages**
5. **Go to Network tab**
6. **Try sending a message**
7. **Look for any red/failed requests**
8. **Click on the failed request and screenshot the details**

## What I need to know:

1. **Console Errors**: Any red errors in console?
2. **Network Request**: Is there a request to `localhost:5001`? What's the status?
3. **ChatClient**: Does console show "✅ ChatClient found" or "❌ ChatClient not loaded"?
4. **Backend Test**: Does console show "✅ Backend reachable" or "❌ Backend fetch failed"?

## Quick Console Test:

Open console and run:
```javascript
// Test 1
typeof window.ChatClient

// Test 2
fetch('http://localhost:5001/api/health').then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log(d))
```

Tell me what you see!
